# ATech.ContactFormServer

A .NET Core WebApi to use on static sites with contact form

If you have a static web site hosted on services like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), there are many chances that you would like to use a contact form to have some feedback from your site's guests or just to get in touch with them.  
There are many options to accomplish the same result, many of them paid, some with a free but feature limited plan, and others that need a little bit of effort to integrate with your contact form.
